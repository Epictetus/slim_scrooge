h1. SlimScrooge - serious optimisation of mysql for activerecord

h2. What is it?

SlimScrooge implements both lazy loading of attributes fetched from mysql, as well as inline query optimisation to ensure that only what you need is fetched from the database.

h2. Benchmarks

It performs much better than plain activerecord, and a bit better than activerecord with slim-attributes.

Todo: nice graph

h2. Installation

Todo.

h2. Tests

SlimScrooge performs the full activerecord test suite without errors, except for tests that check the number of queries performed.
